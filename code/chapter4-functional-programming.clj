;  ------------------------ Trampolining
; A trampoline is a special-purpose solution to a specific problem. It requires
; doctoring your original functions to return a different type to indicate recur-
; sion. If one of the other techniques presented here provides a more elegant
; implementation for a particular recursion, that is great. If not, you will be
; happy to have trampoline in your box of tools.
; You can convert these broken, stack-consuming implementations to use
; trampoline using the same approach you used to convert tail-fibo: simply prepend
; a # to any recursive tail calls:

(trampoline + 3 2)
; 5

; Example only. Don't write code like this.
