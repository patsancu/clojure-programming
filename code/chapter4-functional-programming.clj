; You are giving a sequence of coin toss results, where heads is :h and tails is :t
; [:h :t :t :h :h :h]
; How many times in the sequence does heads come up twice in a row? In the
; previous example, the answer is two. Toss 3 and toss 4 are both heads, and
; toss 4 and toss 5 are both heads.
; The sequence of coin tosses might be very large, but it will be finite.

; So, letâ€™s transform the sequence. When you see this:
; [:h :t :t :h :h :h]
; you should mentally translate that into a sequence of every adjacent pair:
; [[:h :t] [:t :t] [:t :h] [:h :h] [:h :h]]

; Write a function named by-pairs that performs this transformation. Because
; the output of by-pairs varies based on the size of its input, by rule 3 you should
; build this sequence lazily:


; mine, has mistakes

(defn count-head-pairs [coll]
  (count (filter (fn [pair] (every? #(= :h %) pair))
                 (by-pairs coll))))

; 2 is size
